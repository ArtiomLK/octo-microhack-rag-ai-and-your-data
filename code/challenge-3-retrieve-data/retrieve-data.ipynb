To make sure you’re getting the best care possible, it is \\n\\nimportant to find a dentist that is in-network and covered under the Northwind Standard \\n\\nplan. You can search for an in-network provider by using the Northwind Health Provider \\n\\nFinder tool.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to anesthesia, it is important to talk to your dentist about all of the risks \\n\\nassociated with anesthesia before having any procedures. General anesthesia carries the \\n\\nmost risk and can cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Therefore, it is \\n\\n\\n\\nimportant to make sure you are informed about the potential risks associated with any \\n\\nanesthesia that may be used during a dental procedure.  \\n\\nTo ensure that you are getting the best care possible, it is important to stay up-to-date on \\n\\nyour dental care and practice good oral hygiene. Regular brushing and flossing, as well as \\n\\nregular check-ups with your dentist, can help to prevent dental injuries and other dental \\n\\nissues. It is also important to make sure that you are taking advantage of the preventive \\n\\ncare services that are covered under the Northwind Standard plan, such as annual check-\\n\\nups and cleanings.  \\n\\nBy taking advantage of the dental coverage offered through the Northwind Standard plan, \\n\\nyou can be sure that you are getting the care and coverage that you need in order to \\n\\nmaintain your oral health. If you have any questions about the coverage offered under the \\n\\nNorthwind Standard plan, you can contact Northwind Health Customer Service for more \\n\\ninformation. \\n\\nDiagnostic X-Ray, Lab And Imaging \\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC X-RAY, LAB AND IMAGING \\n\\nNorthwind Standard provides coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services. This \\n\\nincludes tests such as MRI, CT scans, x-rays, blood tests, and other lab procedures. The plan \\n\\ncovers the cost of such services when prescribed by a doctor for a medically necessary \\n\\nreason.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services, it’s important to make sure \\n\\nyou’re using a provider that’s in the Northwind network. If you choose a provider who is not \\n\\nin the network, you may be responsible for the full cost of these services. To find a provider \\n\\nin the network, you can use the Northwind website or call their customer service line.  \\n\\nWhen receiving a diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging service, you will likely be responsible for \\n\\npaying a copayment or coinsurance. The exact amount you will be required to pay will \\n\\ndepend on the type of service you receive. You can use the Northwind app or website to \\n\\nlook up the cost of a particular service before you receive it.  \\n\\nIn some cases, the Northwind Standard plan may exclude certain diagnostic x-ray, lab, and \\n\\nimaging services. For example, the plan does not cover any services related to cosmetic \\n\\ntreatments or procedures. Additionally, the plan does not cover any services for which no \\n\\ndiagnosis is provided.  \\n\\nIt’s important to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover any services related \\n\\nto emergency care. This includes diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services that are needed \\n\\nto diagnose an emergency condition. If you have an emergency condition, you will need to \\n\\nseek care at an emergency room or urgent care facility.  \\n\\nFinally, if you receive diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging services from an out-of-network \\n\\nprovider, you may be required to pay the full cost of the service. To ensure that you are \\n\\n\\n\\nreceiving services from an in-network provider, you can use the Northwind provider search \\n\\ntool or call the Northwind customer service line.  \\n\\nBy understanding the Northwind Standard plan’s coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and \\n\\nimaging services, you can make sure that you are receiving the best care possible while \\n\\nminimizing your out-of-pocket costs. \\n\\nDialysis \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dialysis \\n\\nAt Contoso, we understand that dialysis can be an expensive and necessary medical service \\n\\nfor some of our employees.

Make sure to save \\n\\nall of your receipts and submit your claim as soon as possible to ensure that your costs are \\n\\ncovered. \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing our members with quality coverage \\n\\nfor medical treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. With the Northwind \\n\\nStandard plan, you can rest assured that any eligible treatments you receive will be covered. \\n\\nClinical Trials \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Clinical Trials \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we understand the importance of access to clinical trials for our \\n\\nmembers. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or \\n\\ntreat diseases and conditions, and can give members access to treatments and therapies not \\n\\nyet available. Northwind Standard offers coverage for certain clinical trial services, \\n\\nincluding those related to common diseases and conditions.  \\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan covers the cost of certain clinical trial services, and some of \\n\\nthe most common include: \\n\\n• Diagnostic testing and procedures to confirm or diagnose a condition or disease \\n\\n• Treatment of the condition or disease being studied \\n\\n• Medications \\n\\n• Lab services \\n\\n• Imaging services \\n\\nAny other clinical trial services that are not explicitly covered by the Northwind Standard \\n\\nplan may be eligible for coverage on a case-by-case basis. To determine if a clinical trial \\n\\nservice is covered, members should contact the Northwind Health customer service \\n\\ndepartment for more information. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt's important for members to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover travel \\n\\nexpenses associated with attending clinical trials. Additionally, any experimental treatments \\n\\nor services that are not part of the clinical trial are not covered.  \\n\\nWhen considering participation in a clinical trial, members should always consult with their \\n\\ndoctor first to make sure it's the right choice for them. Clinical trials are not for everyone, \\n\\nand it's important to fully understand the risks and benefits before making a decision.  \\n\\nMembers should also be aware that not all clinical trials are free. Some require a fee, and it's \\n\\nimportant to find out what the cost will be before participating.  \\n\\nFinally, members should keep in mind that clinical trials are often available in limited \\n\\nlocations, so they may have to travel to participate in a trial. Northwind Health can provide \\n\\ninformation about nearby clinical trials and may be able to help with the cost of travel.  \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing access to the most innovative \\n\\ntreatments and therapies available. We are proud to offer coverage for certain clinical trial \\n\\nservices, and we are dedicated to helping our members get the care they need. \\n\\nDental Injury and Facility Anesthesia \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dental Injury and Facility Anesthesia  \\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan offers coverage for dental injuries and anesthesia \\n\\nadministered in a dental facility. This coverage covers the services of a licensed dentist or \\n\\ndental specialist, including services related to the diagnosis and treatment of dental injuries, \\n\\nsuch as root canals, crowns, fillings, extractions, and periodontal services.

This plan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription \\n\\ndrug coverage. With Northwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network \\n\\nproviders, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This \\n\\nplan does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse \\n\\ncoverage, or out-of-network services. \\n\\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS \\nSummary of Your Costs \\n\\nWhen you choose Northwind Standard as your health plan, you can rest assured that you \\n\\nare getting comprehensive coverage at an affordable cost. Here, we will explain the various \\n\\ncosts associated with this plan so that you know what to expect when it comes to your out-\\n\\nof-pocket expenses.  \\n\\nPremiums \\n\\nPremiums are the amount of money that you will need to pay each month for your coverage. \\n\\nNorthwind Standard requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis in order to keep \\n\\nthe coverage in force. These premiums are based on the age and health of the policy holder, \\n\\nas well as the type of coverage that is chosen.  \\n\\nDeductibles \\n\\nA deductible is the amount of money that you will need to pay out of pocket before your \\n\\ninsurance plan will begin to cover the costs of your medical services. The deductible for \\n\\nNorthwind Standard is $2,000 per person, per year. This means that you will need to pay \\n\\nthe first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining \\n\\namount.  \\n\\nCo-payments and Co-insurance \\n\\nOnce you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for co-payments and co-\\n\\ninsurance. Co-payments are a fixed amount that you will need to pay at the time of service, \\n\\nwhile co-insurance is a percentage that you will need to pay. For Northwind Standard, the \\n\\nco-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is \\n\\n20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met.  \\n\\nOut-of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nThe out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year. This is \\n\\nthe maximum amount that you will need to pay for your medical expenses in a given year. \\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you have reached this limit, the plan will cover 100% of your expenses for the \\n\\nremainder of the year.  \\n\\nTips for Managing Your Costs \\n\\nThere are several steps that you can take to help manage your costs when you are enrolled \\n\\nin Northwind Standard. Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most out of your \\n\\ncoverage:  \\n\\n• Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100% \\n\\nby the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.  \\n\\n• Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the \\n\\nmaximum benefit from your plan.  \\n\\n• Consider generic prescription drugs when available. These drugs can often be cheaper \\n\\nthan brand-name drugs and are just as effective.  \\n\\n• Talk to your doctor about ways to save money. Many doctors are willing to work with you \\n\\nto find the most cost-effective treatment options available.  \\n\\n• Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully. This document will show \\n\\nyou exactly how much you are being charged for each service and what your plan is \\n\\ncovering.  \\n\\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your Northwind \\n\\nStandard health plan. \\n\\n', 'title': 'Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf', 'url':

This plan also offers \\n\\ncoverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network. \\n\\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS \\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that health care costs can be a burden. That\\u2019s why we \\n\\noffer a comprehensive plan that covers the cost of medical, vision, and dental services. With \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including \\n\\nprimary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan also offers \\n\\ncoverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.  \\n\\nYour cost for Northwind Health Plus will depend on your plan type, the services you use, \\n\\nand the providers you visit. You can find more information about cost-sharing \\n\\narrangements on the Northwind Health website.  \\n\\nIn-Network Costs: If you use an in-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will be lower \\n\\nthan if you use an out-of-network provider. This is because Northwind Health has \\n\\nnegotiated discounted rates with in-network providers.  \\n\\nOut-of-Network Costs: If you use an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for \\n\\npaying the full cost of the services you receive. Additionally, you may have to pay a higher \\n\\ndeductible and coinsurance.  \\n\\nPrescription Drug Costs: Prescription drug costs are also taken into consideration with \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on the tier of the medication \\n\\nyou are prescribed. Generally, brand-name and non-preferred generic medications will have \\n\\nhigher out-of-pocket costs than preferred generic and generic medications.  \\n\\nMental Health and Substance Abuse Coverage: Northwind Health Plus also provides \\n\\ncoverage for mental health and substance abuse services. Generally, coverage for mental \\n\\nhealth and substance abuse services will be the same as coverage for medical and surgical \\n\\nservices.  \\n\\nPreventive Care Services: Northwind Health Plus also covers preventive care services such \\n\\nas immunizations and screenings. Generally, these services are covered at no cost to you. \\n\\nHowever, you will be responsible for any applicable deductibles and coinsurance.  \\n\\n\\n\\nTips: \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure to double-check if a provider is in-network or out-of-network before you \\n\\nreceive care. This will help you avoid any surprise costs.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Take advantage of preventive care services when they are offered. These services are \\n\\ncovered at no cost to you and can help you stay healthy.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Be aware of your plan\\u2019s formulary, which is a list of medications that are covered by your \\n\\nplan. If you are prescribed a medication that is not on the formulary, you may have to pay \\n\\nmore out-of-pocket.  \\n\\n\\u2022 If you have any questions about your costs, you can contact Northwind Health for more \\n\\ninformation. \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nIn-Network Providers \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nChoosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health \\n\\ninsurance plan.

Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying, \\n\\ncopays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has \\n\\nto pay. Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions \\n\\nabout their care. \\n\\nFinally, it\\u2019s important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care \\n\\nservices are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy \\n\\nand avoid costly treatments and services down the road. \\n\\nReaching the out-of-pocket maximum can be a challenge, but with the right knowledge and \\n\\ntips, members can take advantage of their Northwind Health Plus plan and get the most out \\n\\nof their coverage. \\n\\nAllowed Amount \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Allowed Amount  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen receiving services under Northwind Health Plus, you are responsible for paying a \\n\\nportion of the cost of care. The portion of the cost that you are required to pay is known as \\n\\nthe Allowed Amount. The Allowed Amount is the amount that the plan will pay towards the \\n\\ncost of care. The Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received.  \\n\\nFor example, if you receive services from an in-network provider, the Allowed Amount may \\n\\nbe lower than if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. The Allowed Amount \\n\\nalso may vary depending on the type of service received. In general, preventive services \\n\\nsuch as physicals, immunizations, and screenings have lower Allowed Amounts than other \\n\\ntypes of care.  \\n\\nYou should always check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the \\n\\nAllowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving. \\n\\nThis way, you will know what your financial responsibility will be and can plan accordingly.  \\n\\nWhen you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay \\n\\nthe full Allowed Amount up front. You then can submit a claim to Northwind Health Plus for \\n\\nreimbursement of the Allowed Amount less any applicable copays, coinsurance, or \\n\\ndeductibles.  \\n\\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover services that are considered \\n\\nexperimental or investigational. If a service is not covered, you may be responsible for the \\n\\nentire cost of the service. Therefore, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nprior to receiving services to determine if a service is covered. \\n\\nIn addition, some services may be subject to pre-authorization or pre-certification. This \\n\\nmeans that you must obtain approval from Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving the \\n\\nservice. If pre-authorization or pre-certification is not obtained, you may be responsible for \\n\\nthe full cost of the services.  \\n\\nIt is important to understand that the Allowed Amount does not include any applicable \\n\\ncopays, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be due. It is also important to understand that \\n\\nthe Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received and the type of \\n\\nprovider that is providing the care. Therefore, it is important to check with the provider \\n\\nprior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nwill pay for the services you are receiving.  \\n\\nFinally, it is important to keep track of your out-of-pocket expenses. This includes any \\n\\ncopays, coinsurance, or deductibles that you may be required to pay. It is important to \\n\\nunderstand what your financial responsibility is when receiving care under Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus, so that you can plan accordingly and make sure that you are meeting your \\n\\nfinancial obligations.  \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION \\n\\n\\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive health plan that offers coverage for medical, \\n\\nvision, and dental services. It also provides coverage for prescription drugs, mental health \\n\\nand substance abuse services, and preventive care. You can choose from a variety of in-\\n\\n\",\n",

This plan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription \\n\\ndrug coverage. With Northwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network \\n\\nproviders, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This \\n\\nplan does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse \\n\\ncoverage, or out-of-network services. \\n\\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS \\nSummary of Your Costs \\n\\nWhen you choose Northwind Standard as your health plan, you can rest assured that you \\n\\nare getting comprehensive coverage at an affordable cost. Here, we will explain the various \\n\\ncosts associated with this plan so that you know what to expect when it comes to your out-\\n\\nof-pocket expenses.  \\n\\nPremiums \\n\\nPremiums are the amount of money that you will need to pay each month for your coverage. \\n\\nNorthwind Standard requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis in order to keep \\n\\nthe coverage in force. These premiums are based on the age and health of the policy holder, \\n\\nas well as the type of coverage that is chosen.  \\n\\nDeductibles \\n\\nA deductible is the amount of money that you will need to pay out of pocket before your \\n\\ninsurance plan will begin to cover the costs of your medical services. The deductible for \\n\\nNorthwind Standard is $2,000 per person, per year. This means that you will need to pay \\n\\nthe first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining \\n\\namount.  \\n\\nCo-payments and Co-insurance \\n\\nOnce you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for co-payments and co-\\n\\ninsurance. Co-payments are a fixed amount that you will need to pay at the time of service, \\n\\nwhile co-insurance is a percentage that you will need to pay. For Northwind Standard, the \\n\\nco-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is \\n\\n20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met.  \\n\\nOut-of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nThe out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year. This is \\n\\nthe maximum amount that you will need to pay for your medical expenses in a given year. \\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you have reached this limit, the plan will cover 100% of your expenses for the \\n\\nremainder of the year.  \\n\\nTips for Managing Your Costs \\n\\nThere are several steps that you can take to help manage your costs when you are enrolled \\n\\nin Northwind Standard. Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most out of your \\n\\ncoverage:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100% \\n\\nby the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the \\n\\nmaximum benefit from your plan.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Consider generic prescription drugs when available. These drugs can often be cheaper \\n\\nthan brand-name drugs and are just as effective.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Talk to your doctor about ways to save money. Many doctors are willing to work with you \\n\\nto find the most cost-effective treatment options available.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully. This document will show \\n\\nyou exactly how much you are being charged for each service and what your plan is \\n\\ncovering.  \\n\\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your Northwind \\n\\nStandard health plan. \\n\\n\",\n",

This allows you to choose a provider \\n\\nthat is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.  \\n\\nWhen you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower \\n\\ncopays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many \\n\\nservices, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an \\n\\nin-network provider.  \\n\\nIt is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for \\n\\nemergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network \\n\\n\\n\\nservices. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive \\n\\nthem from an out-of-network provider.  \\n\\nWhen choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make \\n\\nsure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by \\n\\ncalling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind \\n\\nStandard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to \\n\\nmake sure your provider is in-network.  \\n\\nSecond, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers \\n\\nmay be in-network but not be taking new patients.  \\n\\nThird, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be \\n\\ndifficult for you to get to your appointments.  \\n\\nFinally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to \\n\\nfind a provider that has evening or weekend hours.  \\n\\nChoosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By \\n\\nfollowing the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is \\n\\nconvenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan. \\n\\nContinuity of Care \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE \\n\\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a \\n\\nquality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind \\n\\nStandard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. \\n\\nWe also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all \\n\\nyour health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care. \\n\\nContinuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to \\n\\ndevelop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in \\n\\nyour health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind \\n\\nStandard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping \\n\\nyou to receive the best possible care. \\n\\nContinuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the \\n\\nsame provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to \\n\\nprovider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won\\u2019t \\n\\nneed to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you\\u2019ve already had done. \\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may \\n\\nneed to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as \\n\\nsurgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your \\n\\ninsurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company \\n\\nand/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs. \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of \\n\\ncare and are getting the best, most affordable care possible. \",\n",

In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the \\n\\nsame amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider. \\n\\nWhen considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the \\n\\npotential risks of doing so. You may end up paying more out of pocket because the provider \\n\\nis not contracted with Northwind Health Plus, or you may be subject to balance billing. \\n\\nIt is important to do your research before seeking care from an out-of-network provider. \\n\\nMake sure to ask questions about the provider\\u2019s billing policies, cost of services, and any \\n\\npotential discounts. It is also important to call Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving care \\n\\nto make sure that the services are covered and to understand your financial responsibility. \\n\\nTips for seeking out-of-network care: \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask the provider if they accept Northwind Health Plus and if they will accept the amount \\n\\npaid by the plan. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask the provider what their billing policies are and if they offer any discounts. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask Northwind Health Plus if the services are covered and if there are any limits or \\n\\nexclusions. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask Northwind Health Plus if you will be subject to balance billing. \\n\\n\\u2022 Check to see if there is an in-network provider available that offers the same services. \\n\\nBy taking the time to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network \\n\\ncare and by doing your research, you can make sure that you are making the best decisions \\n\\nfor your health and your wallet. \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nWhen it comes to healthcare, one of the most important decisions you can make is choosing \\n\\nthe right provider. With Northwind Health Plus, you can select from a wide range of in-\\n\\nnetwork providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and \\n\\npharmacies. This plan also covers emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe provider you choose will have a direct impact on your costs. When you use in-network \\n\\nproviders, you\\u2019ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs. On the other hand, if you use out-of-network \\n\\nproviders, you\\u2019ll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. In some cases, you may be \\n\\nresponsible for the entire cost.  \\n\\nIt is important to note that in-network providers are not necessarily the same across all \\n\\nplans. So, even if a provider is in-network for one plan, they may not be in-network for \\n\\nanother. Therefore, it\\u2019s important to check if your preferred provider is in-network before \\n\\nyou select a plan.  \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, there are a few tips you should keep in mind:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Research your provider\\u2019s credentials. Make sure they are properly licensed and \\n\\naccredited.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about their experience. How long have they been in practice? What kind of patients \\n\\nhave they treated in the past?  \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about their methods. Do they use evidence-based treatments? Are they up-to-date on \\n\\nthe latest medical advancements?  \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about their services. Do they offer preventive care services? What about mental health \\n\\nand substance abuse services? \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about their costs. Do they offer payment plans or discounts? How do they compare to \\n\\nother providers in terms of cost? \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about their availability. Are they available to answer questions or provide guidance \\n\\nwhen needed?  \\n\\n\\u2022 Check reviews. Read reviews from past patients to get a better idea of their experience.  \\n\\nBy taking the time to research your provider, you can ensure that you\\u2019re getting the best \\n\\ncare possible at the lowest cost.  \\n\\nThere are also a few exceptions to be aware of. For example, Northwind Health Plus does \\n\\nnot cover elective or cosmetic procedures. Additionally, some services are only covered \\n\\nwhen they are performed by in-network providers. So, make sure to check the plan\\u2019s \\n\\nprovider network before scheduling any services.  \\n\\n\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network \\n\\nproviders, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider.  \\n\\nExceptions  \\n\\nSome providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan \\n\\ncoverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for \\n\\nservices that are not covered. Additionally, it\\u2019s important to note that there may be different \\n\\nrules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to \\n\\nmental health and substance abuse.  \\n\\nTips  \\n\\nIf you\\u2019re considering a provider that is not in-network, it\\u2019s important to understand the \\n\\ncosts associated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the \\n\\nprovider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for \\n\\nNorthwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you\\u2019ll be paying for \\n\\nservices. Additionally, it\\u2019s important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the \\n\\nprovider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered.  \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, it\\u2019s also important to consider the quality of care they provide. \\n\\nYou should look for providers that offer high-quality care that meets your specific needs. \\n\\nAdditionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right \\n\\nprovider, such as a provider search tool and a provider directory.  \\n\\nChoosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. \\n\\nBy understanding how providers can affect your costs, you can make sure you\\u2019re getting the \\n\\n\\n\\nbest value for your health care services. By using Northwind Health\\u2019s resources and \\n\\nresearching providers in advance, you can make sure you\\u2019re getting the care you need at the \\n\\nbest cost. \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION \\n\\nCopayments (Copays) \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays) \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan includes copayments (copays) for \\n\\ncertain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is \\n\\ngenerally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost \\n\\nof the service.  \\n\\nCopays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive. \\n\\nGenerally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits. \\n\\nFor example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays \\n\\nfor a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from \\n\\nprovider to provider and from state to state. \\n\\nIn addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions \\n\\nand diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10, \\n\\nwhile copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab \\n\\ntests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test. \\n\\nIt is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as \\n\\nemergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you \\n\\nmay be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan \\n\\nand read the fine print before receiving any services. \\n\\nIn addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services. \\n\\nCoinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying. \\n\\nGenerally speaking, coinsurance rates are lower than copays, so it is important to \\n\\nunderstand the difference between the two. \\n\\nFinally, there are some exceptions to the copayment rules. For example, preventive care \\n\\nservices may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams, \\n\\nimmunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes.  \\n\\nOverall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services.

To make sure you\\u2019re getting the best care possible, it is \\n\\nimportant to find a dentist that is in-network and covered under the Northwind Standard \\n\\nplan. You can search for an in-network provider by using the Northwind Health Provider \\n\\nFinder tool.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to anesthesia, it is important to talk to your dentist about all of the risks \\n\\nassociated with anesthesia before having any procedures. General anesthesia carries the \\n\\nmost risk and can cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Therefore, it is \\n\\n\\n\\nimportant to make sure you are informed about the potential risks associated with any \\n\\nanesthesia that may be used during a dental procedure.  \\n\\nTo ensure that you are getting the best care possible, it is important to stay up-to-date on \\n\\nyour dental care and practice good oral hygiene. Regular brushing and flossing, as well as \\n\\nregular check-ups with your dentist, can help to prevent dental injuries and other dental \\n\\nissues. It is also important to make sure that you are taking advantage of the preventive \\n\\ncare services that are covered under the Northwind Standard plan, such as annual check-\\n\\nups and cleanings.  \\n\\nBy taking advantage of the dental coverage offered through the Northwind Standard plan, \\n\\nyou can be sure that you are getting the care and coverage that you need in order to \\n\\nmaintain your oral health. If you have any questions about the coverage offered under the \\n\\nNorthwind Standard plan, you can contact Northwind Health Customer Service for more \\n\\ninformation. \\n\\nDiagnostic X-Ray, Lab And Imaging \\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC X-RAY, LAB AND IMAGING \\n\\nNorthwind Standard provides coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services. This \\n\\nincludes tests such as MRI, CT scans, x-rays, blood tests, and other lab procedures. The plan \\n\\ncovers the cost of such services when prescribed by a doctor for a medically necessary \\n\\nreason.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services, it\\u2019s important to make sure \\n\\nyou\\u2019re using a provider that\\u2019s in the Northwind network. If you choose a provider who is not \\n\\nin the network, you may be responsible for the full cost of these services. To find a provider \\n\\nin the network, you can use the Northwind website or call their customer service line.  \\n\\nWhen receiving a diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging service, you will likely be responsible for \\n\\npaying a copayment or coinsurance. The exact amount you will be required to pay will \\n\\ndepend on the type of service you receive. You can use the Northwind app or website to \\n\\nlook up the cost of a particular service before you receive it.  \\n\\nIn some cases, the Northwind Standard plan may exclude certain diagnostic x-ray, lab, and \\n\\nimaging services. For example, the plan does not cover any services related to cosmetic \\n\\ntreatments or procedures. Additionally, the plan does not cover any services for which no \\n\\ndiagnosis is provided.  \\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover any services related \\n\\nto emergency care. This includes diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services that are needed \\n\\nto diagnose an emergency condition. If you have an emergency condition, you will need to \\n\\nseek care at an emergency room or urgent care facility.  \\n\\nFinally, if you receive diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging services from an out-of-network \\n\\nprovider, you may be required to pay the full cost of the service. To ensure that you are \\n\\n\\n\\nreceiving services from an in-network provider, you can use the Northwind provider search \\n\\ntool or call the Northwind customer service line.  \\n\\nBy understanding the Northwind Standard plan\\u2019s coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and \\n\\nimaging services, you can make sure that you are receiving the best care possible while \\n\\nminimizing your out-of-pocket costs. \\n\\nDialysis \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dialysis \\n\\nAt Contoso, we understand that dialysis can be an expensive and necessary medical service \\n\\nfor some of our employees. \",\n",

Knowing whether you are visiting a primary care physician, specialist, or mental \\n\\nhealth provider will help you to understand how much your copay will be. Your copay \\n\\namount will be listed on your insurance card.  \\n\\nWhen you visit a doctor, you should also inform the office staff that you are a Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus member. This will ensure that the staff bills your insurance correctly and that \\n\\nyou are charged the correct amount for your copay.  \\n\\nIf you have any questions about your copay amount, you can contact Northwind Health's \\n\\ncustomer service team. They will be able to provide more detailed information about your \\n\\ncoverage and copay amount.  \\n\\nIt is important to remember that the split copay only applies to office visits. Other services, \\n\\nsuch as lab tests, X-rays, and imaging tests, are subject to different copay amounts, which \\n\\nare listed on your insurance card.  \\n\\nIt is also important to remember that the split copay only applies to in-network providers. If \\n\\nyou visit an out-of-network provider, you will be subject to a higher copay amount, which is \\n\\nalso listed on your insurance card.  \\n\\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we are committed to helping our members get the care they need \\n\\nat a price they can afford. With the split copay for office visits, we hope to make healthcare \\n\\nmore affordable for you and your family. \\n\\n\\n\\nCalendar Year Deductible \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible \\n\\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan has a calendar year deductible that applies to some \\n\\nservices. The amount you must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered \\n\\nservices is called the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for \\n\\nall members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.  \\n\\nFor In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for \\n\\nindividuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered \\n\\nservices until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. Once \\n\\nthis amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.  \\n\\nFor Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of-\\n\\nnetwork services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than \\n\\nin-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that \\n\\napplies.  \\n\\nExceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible. These services \\n\\ninclude preventive care services and emergency services.  \\n\\nTips:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Be sure to check with your provider to find out if a service is subject to the calendar \\n\\nyear deductible before receiving the service.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure you understand the cost sharing that applies to out-of-network services.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Be aware that the calendar year deductible is reset each year on the plan\\u2019s renewal \\n\\ndate.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Remember that preventive care services and emergency services are exempt from \\n\\nthe calendar year deductible. \\n\\nCoinsurance \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance  \\n\\nCoinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement under Northwind Health Plus. This means that \\n\\nafter you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the \\n\\ncosts for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed \\n\\namount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.  \\n\\nFor example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you \\n\\nare responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the \\n\\nremaining amount of $80.  \\n\\n\\n\\nCoinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, \\n\\npreventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services.

You will also have coverage for treatments that are \\n\\nnecessary after or during dialysis, such as lab tests, imaging, and physical therapy.  \\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for \\n\\nany out-of-network dialysis treatments. In addition, Northwind Standard does not cover any \\n\\ntravel expenses associated with dialysis treatments. If you require care at an out-of-network \\n\\nprovider, you will need to pay for the full cost of treatment.  \\n\\nIt is important to remember that dialysis is a long-term medical treatment. That\\u2019s why it is \\n\\nimportant to find a dialysis provider that is in-network with Northwind Standard. This will \\n\\nhelp ensure that you receive the best care possible and that your treatments are covered by \\n\\nyour insurance plan.  \\n\\nWhen looking for a dialysis provider, it is important to consider factors such as:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Location: Make sure to find a dialysis provider that is conveniently located to you.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Quality of Care: Make sure to research the quality of care that is provided by the dialysis \\n\\nprovider.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Cost: Make sure to research the cost of treatments. \\n\\n\\u2022 Reputation: Make sure to read reviews and ask for referrals from friends and family.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Specialization: Make sure to find a dialysis provider that specializes in the type of dialysis \\n\\ntreatment that you need.  \\n\\nFinally, it is important to remember to keep all of your dialysis records and receipts. This \\n\\nwill help ensure that you are able to receive reimbursement for any covered expenses.  \\n\\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing our employees with the best health care \\n\\ncoverage possible.

Coverage is only available when the condition is an acute medical \\n\\nemergency or injury, and when the emergency room is the only way to receive medical \\n\\nattention. For example, if you experience a broken bone, chest pain, or a head injury, you \\n\\nwould be covered for emergency room services.  \\n\\nExclusions \\n\\nHowever, there are certain services that are not covered under the Northwind Standard \\n\\nplan. Services that are not considered medically necessary, such as elective procedures, are \\n\\nnot covered by the plan. In addition, services that are provided in the emergency room that \\n\\nare not related to the medical emergency, such as lab tests, x-rays, and other diagnostic \\n\\ntests, are not covered by the plan. \\n\\nTips for Utilizing Emergency Room Services \\n\\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you need to visit the emergency room, there are a \\n\\nfew tips that can help you get the most out of your coverage.

It is also \\n\\nimportant to remember that copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to \\n\\nstate, so it is important to do your research before receiving any services. \\n\\nSplit Copay For Office Visits \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits \\n\\n\\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we understand how important it is to have access to quality, \\n\\naffordable healthcare. That's why we provide our members with Split Copay for Office Visits \\n\\nunder the Northwind Standard plan. With this benefit, you can expect to pay a set \\n\\ncopayment for office visits, regardless of the provider you visit. \\n\\nWhat is Split Copay for Office Visits? \\n\\nSplit Copay for Office Visits is a feature of the Northwind Standard plan that allows you to \\n\\npay a set copayment for most office visits. This copayment covers both the provider and the \\n\\nfacility charges for office visits. The amount of the copayment will depend on the type of \\n\\nprovider you visit, such as a primary care physician or specialist.  \\n\\nWho is eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits? \\n\\nAll members of the Northwind Standard plan are eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits. \\n\\nThis benefit is available to all members, regardless of where they live or work. \\n\\nAre there any exceptions? \\n\\nYes, there are some exceptions to the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit. This benefit does \\n\\nnot apply to hospital or emergency room visits, mental health and substance abuse services, \\n\\nor out-of-network services.  \\n\\nAre there any tips I should know about? \\n\\nYes, here are a few tips to help you make the most of the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Before scheduling an appointment, make sure the provider you are visiting is in-network. \\n\\nYou can check your plan's directory of providers for more information.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Many providers are now offering virtual visits, which can be a great way to access care \\n\\nwithout having to leave the comfort of your home.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure to bring your insurance card to every appointment. That way, you can make \\n\\nsure that your copayment is applied correctly.  \\n\\n\\u2022 If you have any questions about the cost of your office visit, don't hesitate to ask your \\n\\nprovider's office. They should be able to tell you exactly how much you can expect to pay for \\n\\nthe visit.  \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing our members with access to quality, \\n\\naffordable healthcare. We hope that the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit will make it \\n\\neasier for you to get the care you need.  \\n\\nCalendar Year Deductible \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual \\n\\nand $4,000 for each family. A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for \\n\\nhealth care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most \\n\\nservices received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, \\n\\nhospitals, and pharmacies.  \\n\\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as \\n\\nimmunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, \\n\\nprescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per \\n\\nindividual and $500 per family.  \\n\\nIt is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means \\n\\nthat you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins \\n\\nto pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not \\n\\nbe subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.  \\n\\nTips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible \\n\\nMeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few \\n\\nsteps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.  \\n\\nFirst, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%.

To determine if a clinical trial \\n\\nservice is covered, members should contact the Northwind Health customer service \\n\\ndepartment for more information. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt's important for members to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover travel \\n\\nexpenses associated with attending clinical trials. Additionally, any experimental treatments \\n\\nor services that are not part of the clinical trial are not covered.  \\n\\nWhen considering participation in a clinical trial, members should always consult with their \\n\\ndoctor first to make sure it's the right choice for them. Clinical trials are not for everyone, \\n\\nand it's important to fully understand the risks and benefits before making a decision.  \\n\\nMembers should also be aware that not all clinical trials are free. Some require a fee, and it's \\n\\nimportant to find out what the cost will be before participating.  \\n\\nFinally, members should keep in mind that clinical trials are often available in limited \\n\\nlocations, so they may have to travel to participate in a trial. Northwind Health can provide \\n\\ninformation about nearby clinical trials and may be able to help with the cost of travel.  \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing access to the most innovative \\n\\ntreatments and therapies available. We are proud to offer coverage for certain clinical trial \\n\\nservices, and we are dedicated to helping our members get the care they need. \\n\\nDental Injury and Facility Anesthesia \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dental Injury and Facility Anesthesia  \\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan offers coverage for dental injuries and anesthesia \\n\\nadministered in a dental facility.

Emergency services are also covered, both in-network and out-of-network.  \\n\\nCo-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums may apply to your plan. Your plan may \\n\\nalso include separate deductibles for different services, such as prescription drugs and \\n\\nhospitalization. It is important to know what your plan covers and what the cost-sharing \\n\\nrequirements are. To get more information, please visit the Northwind Health website or \\n\\ncontact them directly.  \\n\\nIt is also important to remember that there may be certain exceptions or limitations in the \\n\\nplan. For instance, some plans may not cover certain types of services, such as cosmetic \\n\\nprocedures, or they may have limits on the number of visits to a provider that are covered. \\n\\nIt is important to read through your plan to understand what is and isn\\u2019t covered.  \\n\\nWhen you are using your Northwind Health Plus plan, there are a few tips to keep in mind. \\n\\nFirst, remember to bring your Northwind Health Plus ID card with you when you go to the \\n\\ndoctor or pharmacy. This will help the provider verify your coverage and process your \\n\\nclaims. Second, if you are prescribed a medication, check to make sure it is covered by your \\n\\nplan. You may be able to save money by using a generic version of the drug or by using a \\n\\nmail-order pharmacy.  \\n\\nFinally, if you are seeing an out-of-network provider, remember that you may be \\n\\nresponsible for paying more out-of-pocket costs than you would for an in-network provider. \\n\\nMake sure to check with the provider to get an estimate of what your costs will be.  \\n\\nBy understanding the plan and its exceptions and limitations, and by following these tips, \\n\\nyou can make sure you are getting the most out of your Northwind Health Plus plan. \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES \\n\\nAcupuncture \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Acupuncture \\n\\nAcupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in China for thousands of \\n\\nyears. It involves the use of very thin needles inserted into specific points in the body to \\n\\nstimulate energy flow and promote physical and emotional balance. Northwind Health Plus \\n\\ncovers acupuncture services, including both in-network and out-of-network acupuncture \\n\\nproviders. \\n\\nWhen using an in-network acupuncture provider, coverage is provided for up to 12 visits \\n\\nper year. Each visit must be medically necessary and approved by your primary care \\n\\nphysician. All acupuncture services must be performed by an appropriately licensed \\n\\nacupuncturist, and acupuncture services are limited to one hour per visit. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen using an out-of-network acupuncture provider, Northwind Health Plus covers up to \\n\\n$25 per visit, after the deductible has been met. Out-of-network acupuncture services must \\n\\nalso be medically necessary and approved by your primary care physician. All acupuncture \\n\\nservices must be performed by an appropriately licensed acupuncturist and services are \\n\\nlimited to one hour per visit. \\n\\nWhen you visit an acupuncture provider, be sure to bring your Northwind Health Plus \\n\\ninsurance card and a form of payment for the office visit or copayment. You will also need to \\n\\nprovide the acupuncture provider with the authorization from your primary care physician. \\n\\nBefore scheduling an acupuncture appointment, it\\u2019s important to make sure the \\n\\nacupuncturist is licensed and in-network with Northwind Health Plus. It\\u2019s also important to \\n\\ntalk to your primary care physician to make sure that acupuncture is an appropriate \\n\\ntreatment for your medical condition. \\n\\nIn addition to traditional acupuncture treatments, Northwind Health Plus also covers \\n\\nacupuncture-related services such as acupressure, cupping, moxibustion, and tui na. These \\n\\nservices may be covered when provided by an appropriate acupuncturist as part of a \\n\\ntreatment plan approved by your primary care physician. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover services that are experimental, investigational, or for \\n\\ncosmetic purposes. \",\n",

Out-of-network \\n\\ndialysis services may also be covered, but the amount of coverage may vary. It is important \\n\\nto note that Northwind Health Plus does not cover services or supplies related to kidney \\n\\ntransplants, including the cost of the donor organ.  \\n\\nIt is also important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not cover experimental or \\n\\ninvestigational treatments, such as stem cell therapy or xenotransplantation. If you are \\n\\nconsidering a treatment that is not covered by your plan, please contact your provider to \\n\\ndiscuss your options. \\n\\nFor those receiving dialysis services, it is important to note that Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nrequires that you receive your dialysis treatments from a certified dialysis center. It is also \\n\\nimportant to keep track of your dialysis treatments and any supplies that you may need. \\n\\nYour provider may also be able to provide you with information about support groups or \\n\\nother organizations that can provide additional resources or assistance.  \\n\\nIf you have questions about the dialysis coverage offered by Northwind Health Plus, please \\n\\ncontact your provider or Northwind Health directly.

Depending on the \\n\\ntype of plan you have, you may also be responsible for paying a copayment and/or \\n\\ncoinsurance.  \\n\\nOut-of-Network Providers \\n\\nEmergency services received from out-of-network providers will also be covered, but you \\n\\nmay be responsible for higher out-of-pocket costs such as copayments and coinsurance. If \\n\\nyou receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may also be responsible for \\n\\npaying the difference between the amount billed by the provider and the amount the plan \\n\\nwill pay.  \\n\\nExceptions \\n\\n\\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover certain types of emergency services. These include \\n\\nservices for certain social and cosmetic procedures, elective surgery, experimental \\n\\ntreatments, and services for injuries or illnesses that are not medically necessary.  \\n\\nTips for Employees \\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that if you have an emergency, you should seek care from the \\n\\nnearest hospital or medical facility.

      "            \"content\": \"coinsurance does not apply to some services, such as preventive care services.  \\n\\nIt is important to understand the amount of coinsurance you are responsible for. Depending \\n\\non the type of service, your coinsurance could be a percentage of the allowed amount or a \\n\\nfixed amount. This information should be provided to you in your plan documents.  \\n\\nWhen you receive care, you will receive a bill that outlines the cost of the service and the \\n\\namount you are responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and \\n\\ncoinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs.  \\n\\nTips for Using Your Coinsurance:  \\n\\n1. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you \\n\\nmay need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be \\n\\nbetter prepared for the cost.  \\n\\n2. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance \\n\\nrates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.  \\n\\n3. Ask your provider for an estimate of the cost of a service before you receive it. This will \\n\\nhelp you determine how much of the cost you will be responsible for.  \\n\\n4. Keep track of the services you receive and the amount you pay. This will help you \\n\\nunderstand how much you have paid towards your coinsurance requirement for the year.  \\n\\n5. Contact your plan administrator if you have any questions about your coinsurance \\n\\nrequirement or what services are subject to coinsurance. \\n\\nOut-Of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-Of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, members are responsible for costs associated with \\n\\ntheir health care. These costs can include deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out of \\n\\npocket expenses. To help members manage health care costs, the Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nplan offers a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) limit. Once a member has reached the OOP \\n\\nlimit, they pay no more out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the plan year. \\n\\nUnderstanding the Out-of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan\\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum includes deductibles, copays, \\n\\ncoinsurance, and other out-of-pocket expenses. This amount does not include premiums, \\n\\nbalance-billed charges, or charges for non-covered services. The OOP maximum resets at \\n\\nthe start of each plan year, meaning members have to start from scratch when the new plan \\n\\nyear begins. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe OOP maximum applies to all services, including in-network and out-of-network \\n\\nservices, except for non-covered services, balance-billed charges, and premium payments. \\n\\nThis means that all in-network services and out-of-network services count towards the OOP \\n\\nmaximum.  \\n\\nExceptions \\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to the OOP maximum. For example, if a member seeks services \\n\\nfrom a provider that is not in-network, they may be balance-billed for the difference \\n\\nbetween what the provider charges and what Northwind Health Plus allows. Balance-billed \\n\\ncharges do not count towards the OOP maximum.  \\n\\nAnother exception is non-covered services. If a member receives a service that is not \\n\\ncovered by the plan, they may be responsible for paying the full cost of the service. These \\n\\nservices also do not count towards the OOP maximum. \\n\\nTips for Reaching the Out-of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nReaching the OOP maximum can be a challenge, but there are a few tips that can help \\n\\nmembers get there. \\n\\nFirst, it\\u2019s important to understand what services are covered by the plan and which are not. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus covers a wide range of services, including preventive care, primary \\n\\ncare, and specialty care. It\\u2019s important to know which services are covered and which are \\n\\nnot so members can make the most of their coverage. \\n\\nSecond, it\\u2019s important to stay in-network as much as possible. Staying in-network helps \\n\\nmembers get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers \\n\\ntypically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network \\n\\nproviders. \\n\\n\",\n",

Northwind Health Plus also does not cover acupuncture \\n\\nservices that are provided in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility.  \\n\\nIf you have any questions about acupuncture services covered by Northwind Health Plus, \\n\\ncontact the Member Services department at Northwind Health. They are available to answer \\n\\nany questions you may have about coverage and eligibility. \\n\\nAllergy Testing and Treatment \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Allergy Testing and Treatment \\n\\nAt Contoso, we understand that allergies can be a major source of discomfort and \\n\\ninconvenience for our employees. That's why we are proud to offer coverage for allergy \\n\\ntesting and treatment through Northwind Health Plus. Allergy testing and treatment \\n\\nservices are covered under the plan, with some exceptions.  \\n\\nAllergy Testing \\n\\nIf your physician determines that allergy testing is medically necessary, Northwind Health \\n\\nPlus will cover the cost of the testing. This includes skin tests, blood tests, patch tests, and \\n\\nother diagnostic tests that your doctor may order.  \\n\\nAllergy Treatment \\n\\nOnce your doctor has determined the cause of your allergies, Northwind Health Plus will \\n\\ncover the cost of treatment. This includes medications such as antihistamines, nasal sprays, \\n\\n\\n\\nand inhalers. In addition, Northwind Health Plus will cover the cost of immunotherapy, \\n\\nwhich is a long-term treatment that helps to reduce the severity of your allergies. \\n\\nExceptions \\n\\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover all of the costs associated with allergy \\n\\ntesting and treatment. These exceptions include the following:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Allergy medications that are available over-the-counter.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Allergy shots that are not prescribed by a doctor.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Allergy treatments or medications that are considered experimental or unproven.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Alternative treatments, such as herbal remedies or homeopathic treatments.  \\n\\nTips  \\n\\n\\u2022 Talk to your doctor about all of your allergy symptoms, so they can determine the best \\n\\ncourse of testing and treatment.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask your doctor about the cost of any allergy medications that they prescribe.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Be sure to fill any prescriptions at a pharmacy that is in-network, so you can receive the \\n\\nlowest cost for your medications.  \\n\\n\\u2022 If you are considering an alternative treatment for your allergies, be sure to discuss it with \\n\\nyour doctor first.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Keep your receipts for any out-of-pocket expenses related to your allergy testing and \\n\\ntreatment, so you can be reimbursed for your expenses.  \\n\\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing our employees with the best coverage for their \\n\\nhealthcare needs. With Northwind Health Plus, you can be sure that you are getting the best \\n\\ncoverage for your allergy testing and treatment. \\n\\nAmbulance \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Ambulance \\n\\nAmbulance services are covered under Northwind Health Plus. This includes any \\n\\ntransportation to and from medical facilities, as long as it is medically necessary. In most \\n\\ncases, ambulance services are covered when no other form of transportation is available.  \\n\\nIf you need to use an ambulance, it must be one that is in your network and has been \\n\\napproved by Northwind Health. You will be responsible for paying any applicable \\n\\ncoinsurance and copays for this service. If you use an out-of-network ambulance, you may \\n\\nbe responsible for the entire cost of the service. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen deciding whether you need an ambulance, you should consider your medical \\n\\ncondition and the available transportation options. If you are able to use a car or another \\n\\nform of transportation, this will usually be the most cost-effective option. However, if you \\n\\nrequire medical assistance during transportation, an ambulance may be necessary.  \\n\\nIt is important to remember that ambulance services are only covered if they are medically \\n\\nnecessary. If you are unsure of whether a service is medically necessary, you should speak \\n\\nto your primary care physician or a Northwind Health representative.  \\n\\n\",\n",

They can provide you with helpful information \\n\\nand advice about selecting the right provider for your needs.  \\n\\nBy following these tips and doing your research, you can make sure you\\u2019re getting the best \\n\\ncare possible at the lowest cost. With Northwind Health Plus, you can rest assured that \\n\\nyou\\u2019re getting quality coverage for all your healthcare needs. \\n\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION \\n\\nCopayments (Copays) \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays) \\n\\nWhen using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for \\n\\ncertain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service. \\n\\nThe amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the \\n\\nservice is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.  \\n\\nIn-Network Copays:  \\n\\nFor in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services. \\n\\nThe copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a \\n\\ncopayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically \\n\\naround $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no \\n\\ncopayment.  \\n\\nOut-of-Network Copays:  \\n\\nFor out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services. \\n\\nThe copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a \\n\\ncopayment of around $75. For out-of-network emergency services, the copayment is \\n\\ntypically around $150. Please note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover a portion of \\n\\nout-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.  \\n\\nExceptions:  \\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to the copayment amounts listed above. For example, for mental \\n\\nhealth and substance abuse services, the copayment for in-network services is typically \\n\\naround $30 and the copayment for out-of-network services is typically around $60. In \\n\\naddition, the copayment for preventive care services is typically waived if received from an \\n\\nin-network provider.  \\n\\nTips:  \\n\\nIt is important to remember that copayments are subject to change and may vary depending \\n\\non the type of service received. It is also important to note that copayments are not waived \\n\\nfor out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance after \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus has paid its portion.  \\n\\nFinally, it is important to make sure that the provider you are seeing is in-network. This can \\n\\nbe easily done by checking the provider directory on the Northwind Health Plus website. It \\n\\nis also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network \\n\\nprovider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.  \\n\\n\\n\\nBy understanding and following these tips, you can be sure to get the most out of your \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus coverage and avoid unnecessary copayments. \\n\\nSplit Copay For Office Visits \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits  \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus offers a split copay for office visits in order to make healthcare more \\n\\naffordable for its members. This means that you will pay a lower copay for office visits than \\n\\nyou would for other services. The split copay is applied to office visits with primary care \\n\\nphysicians, specialists, and mental health providers.  \\n\\nOffice visits with primary care physicians are subject to a $35 copay. Office visits with \\n\\nspecialists are subject to a $60 copay. Mental health visits with a psychiatrist or another \\n\\nmental health provider are subject to a $45 copay.  \\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to this split copay. Emergency room visits and urgent care visits \\n\\nare not subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to \\n\\nthe type of provider that you visited. Office visits with an anesthesiologist are also not \\n\\n\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible \\n\\nwithout paying out of pocket.  \\n\\nSecond, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large \\n\\nnetwork of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are \\n\\nnot paying more than you have to for services.  \\n\\nThird, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings \\n\\naccount that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are \\n\\ntax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical \\n\\ncosts.  \\n\\nFinally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers \\n\\noffer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of \\n\\nmoney you need to pay out of pocket.  \\n\\nBy following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take \\n\\nadvantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan. \\n\\nCoinsurance \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance \\n\\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your \\n\\ndeductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For \\n\\n\\n\\nexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the \\n\\nservice you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.  \\n\\nUnder Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some \\n\\nexceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, \\n\\ncoinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by \\n\\nthe plan\\u2019s copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for \\n\\npaying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, \\n\\nNorthwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. \\n\\nWhen you receive services, it\\u2019s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure \\n\\nyou are aware of any coinsurance costs. It\\u2019s also important to be aware of the coinsurance \\n\\nrate for out-of-network services and to consider if it\\u2019s worth the cost to pay more for out-of-\\n\\nnetwork services. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed \\n\\namount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what \\n\\nis allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the \\n\\nactual cost.  \\n\\nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard \\n\\nwill allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need \\n\\nservices but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment. \\n\\nFinally, it\\u2019s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket \\n\\nmaximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of-\\n\\npocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket \\n\\nfor services. \\n\\nIn summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is \\n\\ntypically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It\\u2019s important \\n\\nto be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it\\u2019s worth the cost to \\n\\npay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your \\n\\nout-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed. \\n\\nOut-Of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum \\n\\nEmployees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket \\n\\nmaximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain \\n\\ncovered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket \\n\\nmaximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a \\n\\nfamily. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and \\n\\ntreatment of an illness or injury. For example, non-covered services like cosmetic surgery, \\n\\nnon-prescription drugs, or services that were provided outside of the Northwind Health \\n\\nnetwork will not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. \\n\\nIt's important for employees to remember that the out-of-pocket maximum will reset at the \\n\\nstart of the calendar year. This means that any out-of-pocket expenses paid during the \\n\\nprevious year will not carry over to the new year. \\n\\nTo keep track of their out-of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance \\n\\nstatements regularly. They should also review their Explanation of Benefits (EOB) \\n\\ndocuments to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. This \\n\\ncan help them to stay on top of their out-of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the \\n\\nmaximum. \\n\\nEmployees should also be aware that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost \\n\\nof premiums. The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out-of-pocket maximum and \\n\\nis in addition to any out-of-pocket expenses that employees incur. \\n\\nFinally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be \\n\\naware that out-of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. Employees should compare the \\n\\nout-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is \\n\\nbest for them. \\n\\nIn summary, the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out-of-pocket maximum of \\n\\n$6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain \\n\\nservices are not subject to this maximum and that their out-of-pocket expenses will reset at \\n\\nthe start of the calendar year. They should also remember that the out-of-pocket maximum \\n\\ndoes not include the cost of premiums. Finally, they should compare the out-of-pocket \\n\\nmaximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them. \\n\\nAllowed Amount \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: ALLOWED AMOUNT \\n\\nIn the Northwind Standard plan, an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan \\n\\nwill pay for a covered service. It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any \\n\\namount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a \\n\\npercentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed \\n\\namount. \\n\\nIn general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed \\n\\nAmount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for \\n\\npaying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a \\n\\nservice. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if \\n\\nit is more than the Allowed Amount. \\n\\nExceptions:  \\n\\nIn some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be \\n\\nhigher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a \\n\\nnon-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases, \\n\\nthe insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service.  \\n\\nIn addition, some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must \\n\\nbe met before the Allowed Amount is applied. These services may include hospitalization, \\n\\nemergency services, and certain types of outpatient services. \\n\\nTips: \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and \\n\\nwhat their Allowed Amounts are. This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will \\n\\naccept the plan and that you are aware of what your out-of-pocket costs may be. \\n\\nMake sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can \\n\\nreview them against your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This will ensure that you are \\n\\n\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"Balance billing is a practice where a provider bills you for the difference between the \\n\\nallowed amount and billed amount. The allowed amount is the amount that your insurance \\n\\ncompany determines is a reasonable fee for a service. The amount you are billed for is the \\n\\namount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are \\n\\nprotected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be \\n\\nbilled more than the allowed amount by your provider.  \\n\\nBalance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus. This protection \\n\\nensures that you will not be responsible for the difference between the allowed amount and \\n\\nthe billed amount. This protection helps you to avoid unexpected costs.  \\n\\nExceptions: \\n\\n\\n\\nBalance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers. If you receive \\n\\nservices from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the difference \\n\\nbetween the allowed amount and the billed amount.  \\n\\nBalance billing protection also does not apply to certain services, such as cosmetic services \\n\\nand experimental procedures. If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is \\n\\nimportant to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing \\n\\nprotection applies. \\n\\nTips: \\n\\n1. Get preauthorization: When you are planning to receive a service, it is important to get \\n\\npreauthorization. Preauthorization will help you to determine if the service is covered and \\n\\nthe amount that you will be responsible for.  \\n\\n2. Ask questions: Ask your provider questions about the services they are providing and the \\n\\ncost of the services. This will help you to understand the costs associated with the services \\n\\nand to determine if balance billing protection applies.  \\n\\n3. Use in-network providers: Whenever possible, use in-network providers. This will help \\n\\nyou to ensure that balance billing protection applies and that you do not receive unexpected \\n\\nbills.  \\n\\n4. Consider alternative treatments: Consider whether there are any alternative treatments \\n\\nor procedures that may be less expensive. This may help you to keep costs down and to \\n\\navoid balance billing.  \\n\\n5. Know your rights: Make sure that you are aware of your rights when it comes to balance \\n\\nbilling. Northwind Health Plus is responsible for informing you of your rights and for \\n\\nproviding you with balance billing protection.   \\n\\nBy taking the time to understand balance billing protection and to familiarize yourself with \\n\\nthe tips above, you can help to ensure that you are not responsible for unexpected bills. \\n\\nBalance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus and it is important \\n\\nto take the time to understand how it works. \\n\\nBenefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted \\n\\nProviders \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus offers coverage for out-of-network or non-contracted providers; \\n\\nhowever, it is not as comprehensive as the coverage provided for in-network services. \\n\\nWhen you seek care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay more for \\n\\nservices than you would if you had used an in-network option. \\n\\nWhen seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to know exactly what \\n\\nservices are covered and what you will be expected to pay out of pocket. Generally, out-of-\\n\\n\\n\\nnetwork providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted \\n\\nproviders, so the cost of care could be significantly higher. \\n\\nIt is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not \\n\\ncount towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means \\n\\nthat you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable \\n\\ndiscounts.

Working with these providers is an essential part of getting the most \\n\\nvalue out of your plan. \\n\\nIn-Network Providers \\n\\nWhen choosing an in-network provider for your health care needs, make sure to check with \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus to ensure that the provider is in-network. This is important because \\n\\nin-network providers charge lower rates than out-of-network providers. Northwind Health \\n\\nPlus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, \\n\\nspecialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This lets you choose a provider that is most \\n\\nconvenient for you and your family. \\n\\nIt is important to note that in-network providers may not always be available in every area. \\n\\nThe Northwind Health Plus website offers a searchable directory of all in-network \\n\\nproviders in your area. This directory is regularly updated, so you can be sure that you are \\n\\nchoosing from in-network providers that are available in your area. \\n\\nCost Savings \\n\\nUsing an in-network provider can help you save money on health care services. In-network \\n\\nproviders have agreed to charge lower rates for their services, which can help you save \\n\\nmoney on your out-of-pocket costs. In addition, Northwind Health Plus may offer additional \\n\\ndiscounts or cost-savings for using in-network providers. \\n\\nEmergency Services \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the event of an emergency, you can receive care from both in-network and out-of-\\n\\nnetwork providers. However, if you choose to receive care from an out-of-network \\n\\nprovider, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher. Therefore, it is important to consider the \\n\\ncost of out-of-network care when deciding whether to seek emergency care. \\n\\nTips for Choosing an In-Network Provider \\n\\nWhen choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind: \\n\\n\\u2022 Check with Northwind Health Plus to make sure that the provider you are considering is \\n\\nin-network. \\n\\n\\u2022 Use the searchable directory on the Northwind Health Plus website to find in-network \\n\\nproviders in your area. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask your current provider if they are part of the Northwind Health Plus network. \\n\\n\\u2022 Consider the cost savings associated with in-network providers when making your \\n\\ndecision. \\n\\n\\u2022 Consider the quality of care when choosing a provider. \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure the provider is familiar with your health insurance plan and its coverage. \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure the provider is available and can accommodate your schedule. \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\nChoosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health \\n\\ninsurance plan. Northwind Health Plus offers an extensive network of in-network providers \\n\\nthat can help you save money on health care services. By following the tips outlined above, \\n\\nyou can make sure that you are choosing an in-network provider that is most convenient \\n\\nand cost-effective for you and your family. \\n\\nContinuity of Care \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Continuity of Care \\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to understand continuity of care when selecting a provider. Continuity of care \\n\\nis the process of being treated by the same provider or medical team over a period of time. \\n\\nWhen you have continuity of care, your provider has a better understanding of your medical \\n\\nhistory, enabling them to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments. \\n\\nContinuity of care is important when selecting a provider because it ensures better quality \\n\\nof care. When you have continuity of care, your provider is more familiar with your medical \\n\\nhistory, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same \\n\\nprovider for a period of time, the provider will be more likely to know about any changes in \\n\\nyour health and can offer more personalized care.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan offers coverage for continuity of care. This means that if \\n\\nyou have been seeing the same provider for a period of time, you may be able to continue \\n\\nseeing them without having to switch to a different provider in the network. \\n\\nHowever, it\\u2019s important to note that there are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule. \\n\\n\",\n",

With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance \\n\\nbilling when visiting in-network providers. \\n\\nWhat is an in-network provider? \\n\\nIn-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that \\n\\nhave agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan\\u2019s payment terms. Visiting an in-network \\n\\nprovider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network \\n\\nproviders on the Northwind Health website. \\n\\nWhat if I visit an out-of-network provider?  \\n\\nVisiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. \\n\\nOut-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network \\n\\nproviders, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and \\n\\nwhat your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in-\\n\\nnetwork before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs. \\n\\nTips to avoid balance billing:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any \\n\\nservices.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.  \\n\\n\\u2022 If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance \\n\\ncompany to negotiate a lower cost. \\n\\nExceptions to the balance billing protection:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Balance billing protection is not applicable to any non-covered services.  \\n\\nAt Contoso, we want to make sure our employees are provided with the best coverage \\n\\noptions. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer the Northwind \\n\\nStandard plan, which provides balance billing protection when visiting in-network \\n\\nproviders. We encourage our employees to use the tips provided to help reduce the risk of \\n\\nunexpected costs when visiting a provider. \\n\\nBenefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted \\n\\nProviders \\n\\nOne of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is \\n\\nunderstanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When \\n\\nyou receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally \\n\\ncover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an \\n\\nout-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. \\n\\nUnder Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you \\n\\nwill be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best \\n\\nvalue for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between \\n\\nin-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.  \\n\\nIn-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to \\n\\nprovide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the \\n\\namount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the \\n\\ncost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer \\n\\nadditional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers. \\n\\n\\n\\nOut-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with \\n\\nNorthwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment \\n\\noffered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of \\n\\nthe cost. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or \\n\\ndiscounts that are available to in-network providers. \\n\\n\",\n",

The modified cells are then \\n\\ninjected back into the patient\\u2019s body, where they can help to fight off the cancer. This form \\n\\nof treatment is still relatively new, but it has already been used to successfully treat some \\n\\ntypes of cancer. \\n\\n\\n\\nGene therapy is a therapeutic modality that involves the introduction of exogenous genetic \\n\\nmaterial into an individual's cells for the purpose of modifying or correcting pathological \\n\\ngene expression patterns. This process can be accomplished through various vectors, \\n\\nincluding viral and non-viral delivery systems, with the aim of inducing therapeutic effects \\n\\nthrough the modulation of cellular processes. \\n\\nNorthwind Standard covers both cellular immunotherapy and gene therapy. However, there \\n\\nare some exceptions. These treatments are typically only available at specialized centers, \\n\\nand they can be very expensive. As such, Northwind Standard may not cover the full cost of \\n\\nthe treatments. It is important to check with your provider to determine what is and is not \\n\\ncovered by your plan. \\n\\nWhen considering cellular immunotherapy or gene therapy, it is important to do your \\n\\nresearch. Make sure you understand the risks and benefits of the treatment, and be sure to \\n\\ndiscuss any questions or concerns with your doctor. Additionally, it is important to have \\n\\nrealistic expectations about the results of the treatment. It is also important to remember \\n\\nthat these treatments are still in the early stages of development, and that their long-term \\n\\nsuccess is not yet known. \\n\\nIn summary, cellular immunotherapy and gene therapy are two cutting-edge treatments \\n\\nthat are now covered by Northwind Standard. While these treatments are still in the early \\n\\nstages of development and may be expensive, they offer the potential to revolutionize the \\n\\nway we treat diseases. It is important to do your research and discuss any questions or \\n\\nconcerns with your doctor before considering these treatments. \\n\\nChemotherapy And Radiation Therapy \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES: Chemotherapy And Radiation Therapy \\n\\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that medical treatments such as chemotherapy and \\n\\nradiation therapy can be expensive. With Northwind Standard, we provide coverage for \\n\\nthese treatments, so you can have peace of mind knowing that your medical costs are taken \\n\\ncare of.  \\n\\nChemotherapy involves using drugs to treat cancer and other conditions, while radiation \\n\\ntherapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer and other cells. Both types of treatments can \\n\\nbe used to treat a variety of conditions, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and \\n\\ninfections. \\n\\nUnder the Northwind Standard plan, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are both covered \\n\\nservices. This means that you will receive coverage for any eligible treatments that you \\n\\nreceive. The plan covers the cost of the treatment itself, as well as any associated costs such \\n\\nas medications, supplies, and doctor visits. \\n\\nHowever, there are some exceptions to the coverage provided. For example, the plan does \\n\\nnot cover the cost of experimental treatments or treatments that are not medically \\n\\n\\n\\nnecessary. Additionally, the plan does not cover the cost of any hospital stays associated \\n\\nwith the treatment. \\n\\nIf you are considering chemotherapy or radiation therapy, it is important to discuss the \\n\\ntreatment options with your doctor. Your doctor can help you determine which treatments \\n\\nare best for your condition and which treatments are covered under the Northwind \\n\\nStandard plan. \\n\\nIt is also important to remember that chemotherapy and radiation therapy can have side \\n\\neffects. Make sure to discuss any potential side effects with your doctor before beginning \\n\\ntreatment. Additionally, make sure to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and take \\n\\nany medications as prescribed. \\n\\nFinally, make sure to keep track of your medical expenses.

      "            \"content\": \"First, be sure to always keep \\n\\nyour provider information up to date. If you move or change providers, be sure to notify \\n\\nyour insurance company right away. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, be \\n\\nsure to check with your provider to understand any associated costs. Finally, if you are \\n\\nswitching providers or insurance plans, make sure you get copies of your medical records \\n\\nfrom your previous provider. \\n\\nAt Contoso, we strive to provide our employees with access to quality, affordable health \\n\\ncare. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides continuity \\n\\nof care, helping you to receive the best possible care and save money on health care costs. \\n\\nNon-Participating \\n\\nNon-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs \\n\\nWhen selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences \\n\\nbetween participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those \\n\\nwho have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan\\u2019s set rates. Non-\\n\\nparticipating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can \\n\\ncharge the patient more than what the health plan pays. \\n\\nWhen you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be \\n\\nresponsible for paying the difference between the provider\\u2019s actual charges and the amount \\n\\nthe plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your \\n\\nprovider\\u2019s policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to \\n\\ndiscuss this with your provider prior to receiving services. \\n\\nAdditionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of-\\n\\npocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider. For example, if \\n\\nyour provider\\u2019s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the \\n\\nremaining $100 balance billing amount. \\n\\nExceptions \\n\\nThere are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan \\n\\nmay cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain \\n\\nservices provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating \\n\\nproviders. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating \\n\\nproviders\\u2019 charges if there are no participating providers in your area. \\n\\nTips \\n\\nIn order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your \\n\\nprovider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are \\n\\nunsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.  \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find \\n\\nout if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill \\n\\nyou after the health plan pays them. \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating \\n\\nproviders are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some \\n\\nproviders offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services. \\n\\nFinally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check \\n\\nwith your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. \\n\\nAdditionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about \\n\\nthe cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.  \\n\\nBalance Billing Protection \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection \\n\\nAt Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is \\n\\nwhy we\\u2019ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind \\n\\nStandard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are \\n\\nprotected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers. \\n\\nWhat is balance billing?  \\n\\nBalance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and \\n\",\n",

One of the most significant components that affects your costs is \\n\\nthe provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network \\n\\n\\n\\nproviders, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure \\n\\nyou\\u2019re getting the best value for your health care services, it\\u2019s important to understand how \\n\\nproviders can affect your costs.  \\n\\nIn-Network Providers  \\n\\nChoosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your \\n\\nNorthwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on \\n\\nservices, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When \\n\\nselecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for \\n\\nservices, often referred to as a \\u201cco-pay\\u201d or \\u201cco-insurance\\u201d. It\\u2019s important to note that \\n\\ndifferent types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it\\u2019s best to \\n\\ncontact your provider to understand what the cost will be.  \\n\\nOut-of-Network Providers  \\n\\nNorthwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs \\n\\nassociated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network \\n\\nproviders. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire \\n\\ncost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network \\n\\nprovider. \",\n",

In this case, you will not be responsible for any out-of-pocket expenses, as \\n\\nemergency services are covered under Northwind Health Plus. \\n\\nIn addition to emergency services, Northwind Health Plus also covers non-emergency \\n\\nambulance services. These services are typically used when non-emergency transportation \\n\\nis needed to and from a medical facility. If you require non-emergency transportation, you \\n\\nshould speak to your primary care physician who can determine if the service is medically \\n\\nnecessary.  \\n\\nIf your primary care physician determines that ambulance services are medically necessary, \\n\\nyou should contact your local ambulance provider. You should provide them with your \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus plan information and Northwind Health will cover the cost of the \\n\\nservice, minus any applicable coinsurance and copays.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, Northwind Health Plus covers ambulance services when they are medically \\n\\nnecessary. This includes emergency services and non-emergency services. If you need to \\n\\nuse an ambulance, it must be one that is in your network and has been approved by \\n\\nNorthwind Health.

Additionally, if you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of-\\n\\nnetwork provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider. \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, it\\u2019s important to keep continuity of care in mind. Here are a few \\n\\ntips that can help you ensure continuity of care:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Always check your provider\\u2019s network status before scheduling an appointment. \\n\\n\\u2022 If you\\u2019re switching to a new provider, make sure they are in-network. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask your provider if they offer continuity of care. \\n\\n\\u2022 If you are switching to a new provider, make sure they are familiar with your medical \\n\\nhistory.  \\n\\n\\u2022 If you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of-network provider, make \\n\\nsure you understand what that means for your coverage.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure you keep all of your medical records up to date.  \\n\\nContinuity of care is an important factor to consider when selecting a provider. Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus offers coverage for continuity of care, so you may be able to continue seeing the \\n\\nsame provider without having to switch to a different provider in the network. However, \\n\\nthere are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule, so it\\u2019s important to understand \\n\\nwhat those are. By following these tips, you can ensure you have the best possible coverage \\n\\nand ensure continuity of care. \\n\\nNon-Participating \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nWhen it comes to health care, the provider you choose can have a major impact on your \\n\\ncosts. With Northwind Health Plus, you have the option to choose from a variety of in-\\n\\nnetwork providers. However, if you choose to go outside of the network, you may incur \\n\\nadditional costs.  \\n\\nNon-Participating Providers \\n\\nNon-participating providers are providers that are not in-network with Northwind Health \\n\\nPlus. When you visit a provider that is not in-network, you will be responsible for the entire \\n\\ncost of the care. This means that, if you choose to visit a provider who is not in-network, you \\n\\nwill have to pay the entire cost of the service out-of-pocket.  \\n\\n\\n\\nExceptions  \\n\\nThere are some exceptions to this rule. If you are traveling outside of the United States and \\n\\nyou cannot find an in-network provider, you may be able to visit a non-participating \\n\\nprovider and Northwind Health Plus may cover a portion of the cost. Additionally, if you are \\n\\nin a life-threatening situation and need to go to the nearest hospital, Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nmay provide coverage for the care received.  \\n\\nTips  \\n\\nIf you are considering visiting a provider that is not in-network, it is important to check \\n\\nwith Northwind Health Plus first. Before your visit, contact the customer service line to find \\n\\nout if the provider is in-network and if there are any exceptions that could apply to your \\n\\nsituation. Additionally, it is important to review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) after \\n\\nyour visit to ensure that you are not being charged for any services that were not covered \\n\\nby your insurance. If you are charged for a service that was not covered, contact Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus right away.  \\n\\nIf you are considering a new provider, it is important to ask if they are in-network with \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus. This can save you time and money in the long run. Additionally, you \\n\\ncan use Northwind Health Plus\\u2019s online provider directory to search for a provider that is \\n\\nin-network and view their ratings.  \\n\\nBy understanding the difference between in-network and non-participating providers and \\n\\nbeing aware of any exceptions that may apply to you, you can save money on your health \\n\\ncare costs. Northwind Health Plus is here to help you make the most of your coverage. If you \\n\\nhave any additional questions about in-network and non-participating providers, please \\n\\ncontact the Northwind Health Plus customer service line. \\n\\nBalance Billing Protection \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Balance Billing Protection \\n\\n\",\n",

It is generally considered to be safe and effective when administered \\n\\nby a trained and certified practitioner. \\n\\nUnder Northwind Standard, acupuncture is covered as a preventive service. This means that \\n\\nacupuncture treatment is covered at no cost to the employee, before any diagnosis is made \\n\\nor symptoms are present. This coverage is designed to help encourage people to get \\n\\npreventive care before they experience any health problems. \\n\\nHowever, coverage for acupuncture is limited under Northwind Standard. The plan only \\n\\ncovers acupuncture treatments that are administered by a licensed acupuncturist. Self-\\n\\nadministered treatments, such as acupressure or self-treatment with needles, are not \\n\\ncovered. Additionally, the plan only covers acupuncture treatments that are deemed \\n\\nmedically necessary. This means that treatments that are solely for relaxation or cosmetic \\n\\npurposes are not covered. \\n\\nIf you are considering acupuncture as a treatment option, here are some tips to keep in \\n\\nmind:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Make sure the acupuncturist you choose is licensed and certified. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask about the acupuncturist\\u2019s experience and training. \\n\\n\\u2022 Check to see if the acupuncturist is in-network with Northwind Standard. \\n\\n\\u2022 Discuss the risks and expected benefits of acupuncture with your acupuncturist. \\n\\n\\u2022 Ask your acupuncturist to explain the acupuncture treatment plan. \\n\\n\\u2022 Discuss any questions or concerns you have about acupuncture with your doctor. \\n\\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing employees with access to quality and affordable \\n\\nhealthcare.
